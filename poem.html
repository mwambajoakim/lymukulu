	<p class="poem"><strong>M</strong>arching on that day,<br>

		<strong>U</strong>nbeknownst to me there she lay,<br>
		
		<strong>K</strong>nitting not but cooking,<br>
		
		<strong>U</strong>nder her nose a smile, me looking,<br>
		
		<strong>L</strong>uscious lips she has defying beauty,<br>
		
		<strong>U</strong>nscrupulous, lovable and naughty.<br><br>
		
		
		
		<strong>L</strong>ately she comes on to dreams,<br>
		
		<strong>Y</strong>elling not but whisperings in my ears,<br>
		
		"<strong>D</strong>on't worry we'll soon watch those films",<br>
		
		<strong>I</strong>ndescribable peace that calms my fear,<br>
		
		<strong>A</strong>ll for what? Maybe good things, top tier.<br><br>

		In short you are a beautiful, amazing person who is attractive in the way she cares <br>and moves. Someone who I can reason with and I am sure there is a lot more beauty I still do not know about.<br><br>XoXo<br>Mwamba.
